##Overview

Simple basic handling of XML files for both reading and manual creation. You can specify your own mapping prefixes, set attributes on each element, add and remove cild items, iterate over childs and so on.


##Installation
####Via CocoaPods
Just add `pod 'CNXML'` to your podfile.


####Via Git SubModule
`cd` into your project directory and execute `git submodule add https://github.com/phranck/CNXML.git $DIR_WHERE_YOUR_SUBMODULES_ARE_PLACED`

You have to replace the `$DIR_WHERE_YOUR_SUBMODULES_ARE_PLACED` with the real path where your submodules are placed.


####Via Drag&Drop
Just drag the `CNXMLReader.*` and `CNXMLElement.*` files into your project.


##Requirements
`CNXML` was written using ARC and runs on 10.7 and above.
